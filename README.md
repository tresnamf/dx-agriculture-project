#### 2. Flash Raspberry Pi
- Prepare a microSD card (at least 16GB is recommended) and a card reader.
- Download Raspberry Pi Imager (according to your PC operating system): https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
- Run Raspberry Pi Imager.
- Open the Imager: launch the application and select "Choose OS" to choose the operating system.
- Select Storage: click "Choose Storage" and select your microSD card.
- Click "Write" to start the flashing process and wait until verification is completed.
- After completion, remove the microSD card and insert it into the Raspberry Pi 4 for the first boot.

### 3. Memeriksa Python environment in Raspberry Pi
- Secara default, Raspberry Pi OS sudah ter-install Python.
- Buka terminal, ketik
```bash
python3 --version


#### 3. Building Web-based Automatic Sensor Logger for Experimental Monitoring
